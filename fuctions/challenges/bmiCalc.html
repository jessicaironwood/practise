/* If my weight is 65Kg and my height is 1.8m, I should be able to call your function like this:

var bmi = bmiCalculator(65, 1.8); 

bmi should equal 20 when it's rounded to the nearest whole number.
Your challenge is to create a function that takes weight and height as
 inputs and gives the calculated BMI value as an output. The output should be
  rounded to the nearest whole number.

The first parameter should be the weight and the second should be the height.

NOTE: You do not need to write any alerts or prompts or console logs. 
Your code should only contain the function, the result has to be returned 
by the function. You do not need to call the function.

//var weightVar = prompt ("Please input the weight in kg");
// var heightVar = prompt ("Please input the height in meters");
// var bmiCalculator = weightVar / (heightVar ** 2);
// var lbmiCalculator = Math.round(bmiCalculator)
// console.log(lbmiCalculator)
